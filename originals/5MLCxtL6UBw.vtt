00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.840
work with them. That's I harmonizing with&nbsp;
their energy. All right? Not cranking on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.800
their body. That's not really what&nbsp;
iikido is about. Doesn't matter. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.120
let's go back to our freestyle practice.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:38.400
and see if we can listen to them&nbsp;
at a subtler level. Listening to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:47.680
the whole system. Don't get lost in in this&nbsp;
stuff. Once more, please. The whole system.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:55.360
And

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:02.000
if you do find that whatever happening, we&nbsp;
all make mistakes, but just at that point,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:18.160
listen. And listening to the whole system&nbsp;
at a subtler level. Thank you. Please.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.880
Now, when we started in the more static form,&nbsp;
we did that because it's a little more tangible.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.760
And when you're wrong, it becomes more obvious&nbsp;
and you can start to look for a more blending,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:42.560
listening, fluid, harmonious, I key kind of&nbsp;
movement. All right. You should be in a place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.240
that's comfortable for you as you work with them&nbsp;
because if you start to get bent out of shape,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.240 --> 00:02:00.560
Mr. Hyde comes out. And uh besides that, you&nbsp;
just don't enjoy yourself as much as when you're

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:08.080
having fun pretending like&nbsp;
you enjoy it. Okay, Chiaza.
